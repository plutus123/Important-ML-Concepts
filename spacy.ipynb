       "tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements\n",
       "for independence. Through such movements the nationalists\n",
       "tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups\n",
       "and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations\n",

       "grievances were wide-ranging,\n",
       "freedom from colonial rule also\n",
       "meant different things to\n",
       "different people. The Congress\n",
       "continuously attempted to\n",
       "resolve differences, and ensure\n",
       "that the demands of one group\n",
       "did not alienate another. This is\n",
       "precisely why the unity within\n",
       "the movement often broke down.\n",
       "The high points of Congress\n",
       "activity and nationalist unity\n",
       "were followed by phases of\n",
       "disunity and inner conflict\n",
       "between groups.\n",
       "In other words, what was emerging was a nation with many\n",
